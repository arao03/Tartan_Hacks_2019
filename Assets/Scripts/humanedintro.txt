You have chosen to continue your education. Starting at your new school, you feel incredibly nervous. As you walk towards the building, an elf walks up beside you, clearly headed to the same place. She smiles at you and says "Hello," being friendly. It appears as if she may be nervous as well. You smile back, and the two of you walk into the building together. Once inside, she selects a seat on the right side of the room - there is an empty seat next to her. On the left side of the room, you notice two other humans sitting together, there is an empty seat beside them as well. The four of you are the only ones in the room.
