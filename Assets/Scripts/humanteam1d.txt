You have chosen to join the Dwarf team.
The dwarf apprentice smiles at you a little wider this 
time and asks What’s your name? As you walk over to the 
team. You tell him My name is __name__. 
My name is Fovik, he says. 
The other two members of the team incline their heads 
slightly in acknowledgement.
After preparing the furnaces, both teams are allowed a 
short break for lunch. You decide to get out of the stuffy 
furnace room and walk outside for a bit. As you walk out, 
you overhear one of the dwarves muttering to himself. 
He says he can’t believe they’re stuck in a shop with humans; 
he says humans make him feel inferior even though he is 
confident in his work. You realize Fovik may have just been 
being polite since you are a human who he sees as superior.
After your break when you walk back into the furnace room, 
Fovik has already returned to the dwarven team’s furnace, 
although he is the only one there. 
Two of the humans have also returned.
