You have chosen to join the human team. They acknowledge your presence as you join them, but aside from general machining instructions, none of them talk much. Fovik looks a bit hurt initially, but doesn’t say anything. As days go by you tend to hang out more with the humans in your shop than the dwarves, and although you see Fovik around, neither of you bother to talk to each other. You have your team and he has his. Both of you are content. After two years you complete your apprenticeship. You plan to work as a junior metallurgist in the shop, similar to all of the younger tradesmen there. A few days later, as you’re sorting through old machining references, you notice a book you have never seen before. It has two bookmarks in it - one red and one blue.
