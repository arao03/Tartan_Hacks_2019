You have chosen to say nothing about the blade. You purchase your traveling cloak and leave the shop. Kaylin leaves immediately after you, knife in hand. She waves a farewell, and you do the same. As you head home, you forget about her completely, and you turn your attention to the metal shop for the rest of the winter. Four months later, you prepare to leave. The night before you are set to do so, you notice an extra book in your room that you have never seen before. It has two bookmarks in it - one red and one blue.
