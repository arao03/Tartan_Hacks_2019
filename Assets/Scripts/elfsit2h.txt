You have chosen to sit with Annabelle again.
Annabelle smiles brightly as you walk over. 
She asks How has your day been? 
And you answer with It’s been good. 
You realize that your worries yesterday were ungrounded 
and that Annabelle is just shy. The two of you become very 
close friends over the course of the year.
After two years of school, you and Annabelle graduate as 
close friends. Although some of the other elves and humans 
scoff at your closeness across racial borders, the two of you 
laugh it off. You don’t care that she is a human and 
she doesn’t care that you’re an elf.
A few days later, Annabelle shows up at your door with a book. 
Are you up for an adventure? She asks. 
Sure, you say, not knowing exactly what she means. 
Annabelle hands you the book. 
It has two bookmarks in it - one red and one blue.
