You have chosen to pursue your education in a traditional setting.
Starting at your new school, you feel a bit nervous. 
As you walk towards the building, a human walks up beside you, 
clearly headed to the same place. 
She smiles at you and says Hello, being friendly. 
It appears as if she may be a bit embarrassed about something. 
You smile back and the two of you walk into the building together.
Once inside, she selects a seat on the right side of the room. 
There is an empty seat next to her. On the left side of the room, 
you notice two other elves sitting together, there is an empty seat 
beside them as well. The four of you are the only ones in the room.
