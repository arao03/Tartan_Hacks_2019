You have chosen to smile back at the dwarf. You see the dwarf’s eyes brighten at your acknowledgment and he beckons you over. "My name is Fovik," he says, and shows you a cast part he has been working on. To your untrained eye, it doesn’t look like much, but the way Fovik is speaking, it sounds as if the part took a lot of careful craftsmanship and he is quite proud of it. You grow slightly impressed. A minute later your tutor returns and motions for you to leave with him. As you leave the shop, he mutters about how uneducated and simple-minded dwarves are. He glances at you, noticing you are quiet. Press the left arrow key to defend Fovik or the right arrow key to remain silent.
