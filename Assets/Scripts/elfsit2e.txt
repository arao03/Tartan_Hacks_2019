You have chosen to sit with the other elf.
The other elf acknowledges your presence as you sit 
beside him, but doesn’t say anything. 
Annabelle looks a bit hurt, but also doesn’t say anything. 
You tend to hang out more with the elves in your school 
than the humans, and although you see Annabelle around 
occasionally, neither of you bother to talk. 
You have your friends and she has hers. Both of you are content.
After two years of school your group of ten graduate. 
You plan to pursue a career in policy and leadership, 
similar to your classmates.
A few days later, as you’re organizing your old school supplies, 
you notice a book you have never seen before. 
It has two bookmarks in it - one red and one blue.
