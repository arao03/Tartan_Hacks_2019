You have chosen to sit with the other human.
The other human acknowledges your presence as you sit beside him, 
but doesn’t say anything. Kaylin looks a bit hurt, but also doesn’t say 
anything. You tend to hang out more with the humans in your school than 
the elves, and although you see Kaylin around occasionally, neither of 
you bother to talk. You have your friends and she has hers. 
Both of you are content.
After two years of school your group of ten graduate. You plan to get an 
apprenticeship and begin your career as a metallurgist, similar to all 
of your classmates.
A few days later, as you’re organizing your old school supplies, 
you notice a book you have never seen before. It has two bookmarks in it - 
one red and one blue.
