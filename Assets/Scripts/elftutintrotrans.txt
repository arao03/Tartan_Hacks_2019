One day, after the conclusion of your lesson, your tutor mentions he is heading to the metallurgy shop looking for a new knife. Feeling stifled indoors, you decide to accompany him there. Upon your arrival, a dwarf hurries up to you. Your mentor explains looking for a knife and the dwarf leads him to another part of the shop, calling him sir. You look around and notice a young dwarf looking at you. He smiles a toothy grin at you. Press the left arrow key to smile back or the right arrow key to turn your attention elsewhere.
