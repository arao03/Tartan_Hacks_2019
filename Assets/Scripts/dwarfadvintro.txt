You have chosen to go on an adventure. Because it is nearing winter, you decide to wait for a few months before leaving. You inform you family of your plans, and surprisingly receive no protest. They are supportive of you, especially your brother.Not long after, while you are looking for a traveling cloak, you meet an elf in the same store. She turns to look at you and smiles. "My name is Kaylin," she says, "Who are you?" You tell her, "My name is __name__." She nods. "Pleasure to meet you __name__." You notice she is holding a hunting knife - a surprising article for an elf in this society. Due to your familiarity with metals, you notice that this particular knife is cheaply made, though you are hesitant to say anything. It would be breaking norms to say so, even if it would be beneficial.
