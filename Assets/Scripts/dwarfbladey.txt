You have chosen to point out the cheap blade. "Your knife - I think you could get a better one. That blade is pretty cheap." Kaylin looks surprised. "You can tell? That’s quite amazing." She smiles. "I suppose it makes sense. You probably know your way around metals. " You smile back. The two of you continue talking, and eventually you mention how you are planning on going on an adventure at the onset of spring. Kaylin exclaims, "That’s so exciting. I’ll come with you!" You laugh and accept. For the next few months, you and Kaylin become close friends. Although others scoff at your closeness across racial borders, the two of you laugh it off. You don’t care that she is an elf, and she doesn’t care that you’re a dwarf. Come spring, Kaylin shows up at your door with a book. "Ready for an adventure?" "Of course!" you say. Kaylin hands you a book. It has two bookmarks in it - one red and one blue.
