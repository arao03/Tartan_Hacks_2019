You have chosen to sit down beside the elf.
She smiles at you a little wider this time and asks What’s your name?. 
You tell her, My name is __name__. My name is Kaylin, she says. 
A few other students trickle in - 
there are six humans and four elves in total.
After class, Kaylin waves goodbye and disappears. As you’re walking out 
you overhear two of the other elves talking. They say they can’t believe 
they’re stuck in a school with humans; they say humans are dumb and don’t 
have enough education. You realize Kaylin may have just been pitying you 
for being human and therefore less intelligent.
The next day when you walk into the room, Kaylin is sitting in the same 
place as yesterday. One of the other humans is sitting on the 
left side of the room.
