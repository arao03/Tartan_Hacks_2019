Welcome to Fyrne. In this land, humans, elves, and dwarves, coexist and are at peace. Unique to this land, the equality of every individual under the law is strictly guaranteed, although Fyrne still faces the unfortunate reality of social disparity. Elves are considered to be the social elite - their slow aging and light physique have allowed them to rise to leadership positions. Although a few elves do not walk among this highest tier, elves as a race are thought of as superior, although there are no explicit biases in their favor. Humans are very adept at nearly all tasks; they are considered very “well-rounded” and make up most of society’s middle class. Humans are particularly clever, though their shorter lifespans have prevented them from attaining long-lasting leadership.  Dwarves are easily the strongest of the three races. They are known for their craftsmanship and hard work, but also intense loyalty. However, through no fault of their own, dwarves have become social outcasts due to their stockier physique, and stereotypically slower wit. Although the above descriptions do not necessarily apply on an individual basis, they do dictate the lifestyle of every member of the race - to a greater or lesser degree. You will now select a race. This choice, like all of your coming choices, can not be taken back and will irreversibly impact your adventure. Make it wisely.
