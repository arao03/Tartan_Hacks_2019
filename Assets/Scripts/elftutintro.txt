You have chosen to hire a tutor to continue your education. Your tutor comes to your house every day and teaches you the finer points of policy and leadership. For the next few months, you learn literary strategies and proclamation drafting. Your tutor is extremely impressed with your progress. One day, after the conclusion of your lesson, your tutor mentions he is heading to the metallurgy shop looking for a new knife. Feeling stifled indoors, you decide to accompany him there. Upon your arrival, a dwarf hurries up to you. Your mentor explains looking for a knife and the dwarf leads him to another part of the shop, calling him sir. You look around and notice a young dwarf looking at you. He smiles a toothy grin at you.
