You have chosen to sit with Kaylin again.
Kaylin smiles brightly as you walk over. 
She asks How has your day been? And you answer with It’s been good. 
You realize that your worries yesterday were ungrounded and that 
Kaylin is just shy. The two of you become very close friends 
over the course of the year.
After two years of school, you and Kaylin graduate as close friends. 
Although some of the other elves and humans scoff at your closeness 
across racial borders, the two of you laugh it off. 
You don’t care that she is an elf 
and she doesn’t care that you’re a human.
A few days later, Kaylin shows up at your door with a book. 
Are you up for an adventure? She asks. 
Sure, you say, not knowing exactly what she means. 
Kaylin hands you the book. It has two bookmarks in it 
- one red and one blue.
