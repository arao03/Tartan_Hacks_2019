You have chosen to sit with the two humans. They acknowledge your presence as you sit beside them, but neither says anything. The elf looks a bit hurt, but also doesn’t say anything. A few other students trickle in - there are six humans and four elves in total. As days go by you tend to hang out more with the humans in your school than the elves, and although you see the elf around occasionally, neither of you bother to talk to each other. You have your friends and she has hers. Both of you are content. After two years of school, your group of ten graduate. You plan to get an apprenticeship and begin your career as a metallurgist, similar to all of your classmates. A few days later, as you’re organizing your old school supplies, you notice a book you have never seen before. It has two bookmarks in it - one red and one blue.
