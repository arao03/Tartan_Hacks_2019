You have chosen to be a human. As a human, you may consider yourself to be of “middle-class” status. Like most everyone you know, you attend school for seven years. During that time, you have learned the basics of literacy - you are able to read and write in the common language, although complex and historical papers still boggle your mind. You have also learned simple weaponry and self defense tactics, like all other educated members of the society. Because you are a human, you were additionally trained in battle strategy and and basic mechanisms. After completing your seventh year in school, you may choose to either continue your education in strategy, or you may go into trade - working as a metallurgist and weapons designer. You know that continuing your education likely means increased interactions with elves, while going into trade will mean increased interactions with dwarves. At this point in your life, you have had very little interaction with either.
