You have chosen to turn your attention elsewhere.
Aside from the dwarf, there is no one else in the shop. 
As you look around however, you see various curved blades 
and knives, presumably crafted by the dwarves here. 
To your untrained eye, they look well-made, but not unique. 
The young dwarf has a piece of metal on an anvil, 
but you have no idea what it’s meant to be.
A minute later your tutor returns and motions for you to 
leave with him. Once outside, he bids you farewell for the evening. 
As you walk away from the metals shop, you hear the hissing sound 
of hot metal and pounding hammers, but you think nothing of it.
Two years later, you complete your secondary education. 
You plan to pursue a career in policy and leadership, 
similar to your others of your status.
A few days later, as you’re organizing your old books, 
you notice one you have never seen before. 
It has two bookmarks in it - one red and one blue.
