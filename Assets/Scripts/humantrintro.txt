You have chosen to go into trade. You walk into the metallurgy shop ready for your first day as an apprentice. Less than a minute after you arrive, a dwarf walks up next to you. He is also there as an apprentice. He smiles at you and says "Hello", being friendly. It appears he may be a bit embarrassed. You smile back as your mentor walks up to the both of you. Your mentor walks you over to a pair of steel furnaces and asks you to prepare them for casting parts. You notice one team has four people - all humans, while the other has only two people, who are both dwarves. The dwarf apprentice walks over to the dwarf team.
