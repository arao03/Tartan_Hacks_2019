You have chosen to remain silent. Your tutor stops talking about dwarves, and bids you farewell for the evening. As you walk away from the metals shop, you hear the hissing sound of hot metal and pounding hammers, but you think nothing of it. Two years later, you complete your secondary education. You plan to pursue a career in policy and leadership, similar to others of your status. A few days later, as youâ€™re organizing your old books, you notice one you have never seen before. It has two bookmarks in it - one red and one blue.
