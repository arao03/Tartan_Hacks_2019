You have chosen to be an elf. 
As an elf, you may consider yourself to be of “elite” status. 
Like most elves you know, you attend school for seven years. 
During that time, you have become fluent in both elvish and 
the common language - you are able to read and write in both. 
You have also learned simple weaponry and self defense 
tactics, like all other educated members of the society. 
Because you are an elf, you were additionally trained in 
mathematics and art. After completing your seventh year in 
school, you may choose to either continue your education in 
a traditional school setting, or you may hire a private 
tutor - an option only available to elves. You know that a 
traditional school setting likely means increased interactions 
with humans, while hiring a private tutor will mean 
interacting almost exclusively with elves. 
At this point in your life, you have had very little 
interaction with any race apart from your own.
