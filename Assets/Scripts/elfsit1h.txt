You have chosen to sit down beside the human.
She smiles at you a little wider this time and asks What’s your name?. 
You tell her, My name is __name__. 
My name is Annabelle, she says. 
A few other students trickle in - there are six elves and 
four humans in total.
After class, Annabelle waves goodbye and disappears. As you’re walking 
out you overhear two of the other humans talking. They say they can’t 
believe they’re stuck in a school with elves; they say humans make them 
feel inferior even though they is confident in their abilities. 
You realize Annabelle may have just been being polite since you are an 
elf who she sees as superior.
The next day when you walk into the room, Annabelle is sitting in the 
same place as yesterday. One of the other elves is sitting on the left 
side of the room.
