You have chosen to return to the Dwarf team with Fovik. Fovik smiles brightly as you walk over. He asks "How was your lunch break?," and you answer "It was good." You realize that your worries were ungrounded and that Fovik is just a quiet type. The two of you become very close friends over the course of the coming months. After two years, you and Fovik complete your apprenticeships as close friends. Although some of the other dwarves and humans scoff at your closeness across racial borders, the two of you laugh it off. You don’t care that he is a dwarf and he doesn’t care that you’re a human. A few days later, Fovik shows up at your door with a book. "Are you up for an adventure?" he asks. "Sure," you say, not knowing exactly what he means. Fovik hands you the book. It has two bookmarks in it - one red and one blue.
