You have chosen to defend Fovik. You tell your tutor that dwarves arent necessarily more simple-minded, and that some of the items you saw in the shop appeared as if they would have required great skill to make. Your tutor is a bit taken aback by your brashness, but nods silently, thinking. A moment later, you hear heavy footsteps behind you, and turn to see Fovik standing there. He beams at you and says "I heard what you said just now and I really appreciate it. It means a lot, especially coming from someone of your status." He offers his hand to you and you accept it. After two years, you and Fovik have become close friends, and your tutors opinion of dwarves has greatly improved. Although others scoff at your closeness across racial borders, the two of you laugh it off. You dont care that he is a dwarf and he doesnt care that youre an elf. One day, Fovik shows up at your door with a book. "Are you up for an adventure?" he asks. "Sure," you say, not knowing exactly what he means. Fovik hands you the book. It has two bookmarks in it - one red and one blue.
